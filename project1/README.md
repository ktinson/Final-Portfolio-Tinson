## Project #1 brief: Blog Backend
The application serves as a resource to further communication avenues for users. Similar to a blog from the 90's, users will be able to create accounts, log in , create and edit their posts, and view their post history from the database. Admin will have the added authority of being able to view all user content.

## Problem Statement:
Users would like to securely sign into their social platforms.

## Importance of Solving the Problem Now:
User data is a protected resource and exposure opens them up to unnecessary risk.

## Opportunity:
Giving users a secured way to sign in protects not only their content, but their data and associated accounts as well.

## Target Audience:
People that like to take notes and records to record the days actions.

## Definition of Done:
A backend that allows a user to sign up, log in, create / edit content, and hand has admin functionality.

## Success Metrics / OKRs:
Users can complete blog actions to create and view content
Admin can has specific permissions
Secrets are hashed in the database
